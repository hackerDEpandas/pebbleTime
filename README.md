# Linear Regression (Machine Learning)  for Pebble Time

### Introduction
For this project I used machine learning to try and perdict a final **TotalFundingRaised** for the popular Kickstarter project **Pebble Time**. In specific, the following documantation provides insight on collecting and organizing data to later be ran through the *Linear Regression* machine learning method.

### About Linear Regression
Linear Regression is used to find a line that best fits any given data set. Using Calculus the *Gradient Decent* algorithm minimizes the cost function and eventually spits out coefficents for the function to the "best-fit-line". In this particular example I use only the single variable case for linear regression as I was only concerned with the **TotalFundingRaised** data point. More information about * Linear Regression* can be found on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml).
